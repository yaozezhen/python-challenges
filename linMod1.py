# function descriptor: linMod1(a,b,m)
# solves linear modular equation of the form: ax (mod m) = b (mod m)
# a - integer coefficient of x on left side of equation
# b - integer constant on right side of equation
# m - integer modulus number
# conditions: no need to return multiple solutions, as long as it solves the equation
#             should be a valid equation that has an integer solution (e.g. x is an integer in Z_m)
# return type: integer
# example: (a,b,m) - (3,7,4) => returns 1
